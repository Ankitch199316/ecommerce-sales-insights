# 📦 Brazilian E-Commerce: Sales & Delivery Analytics Project

### 📁 Project Overview

This project analyzes large-scale e-commerce transaction data (~100k orders) to evaluate seller performance and revenue concentration in a marketplace environment.

The goal is to understand how revenue is **distributed across sellers and regions**, **identify concentration risks**, and **demonstrate how data can inform decisions around seller strategy, diversification, and marketplace stability**.

---

## 🧠 Project Intent & Scope

This project was designed to simulate a realistic e-commerce analytics workflow, where analysts must work with messy, multi-table transactional data, align technical analysis with business questions, and communicate insights clearly to non-technical stakeholders.

The work spans the full analytics lifecycle:
- Data ingestion and cleaning
- Multi-table joins and enrichment
- Metric definition and validation
- Analysis focused on seller performance and revenue distribution
- Interactive dashboards built for business consumption

---

## 📊 Business Goals

**Primary Goal**
- Assess **seller revenue concentration** to understand dependency risks and performance imbalance within the marketplace.

**Supporting Analyses**
- Analyze revenue trends across time and geography to identify exposure patterns.
- Evaluate high-performing product categories in relation to seller performance.
- Examine delivery performance and logistics challenges impacting seller outcomes.
- Compare payment method usage to understand its relationship with revenue distribution and customer behavior.

## 🧪 Steps Performed

### 1. **Data Acquisition & Exploration**
- Loaded multiple CSV files
- Explored schema and checked for nulls and duplicates
- Conducted `info()` and `head()` evaluations

### 2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- Merged datasets (`order_items + products → orders`)
- Added delivery days calculation
- Standardized column names
- Filtered out incomplete or missing records
- Translated category names for better readability

### 3. **Enrichment & KPI Calculation**
- Calculated total revenue per order
- Added payment type insights: `% of orders`, `revenue`, `installments`
- Extracted revenue over time by month and payment method
- Generated seller KPIs:
  - Top 10 Sellers by Revenue
  - Seller Count by State
  - Revenue by State
  - Revenue Distribution Histogram

### 4. **Exported Processed Datasets**
- Clean datasets were exported as `.csv` and fed into Tableau for visualization.

## 📈 Business Insights & Recommended Actions

| 🔍 Insight | 💡 Business Action |
|-----------|--------------------|
| **76% of customers used credit cards for payment** | Focus marketing promotions and loyalty programs around credit card users. Consider partnerships with credit card companies to offer cashback or EMI plans. |
| **Credit card users used an average of 3.6 installments** | Enable or highlight installment options more clearly during checkout to increase average order value. Bundle high-value items with flexible EMI plans. |
| **SP (São Paulo) and RJ (Rio) generate the most revenue and have the most sellers** | Prioritize logistics, seller acquisition, and fulfillment capabilities in these high-performing regions. Launch region-specific seller training or incentives. |
| **Office furniture and related categories had the longest delivery times (~20 days)** | Reevaluate the shipping and fulfillment process for bulky or slow-moving categories. Consider local warehousing or alternate 3PL partners. |
| **Revenue spikes observed in May & August, then dips** | Investigate historical campaigns or shopping events during those peak months. Strategically plan promotions or influencer pushes to replicate success. |
| **Seller revenue is highly concentrated among a few top sellers** | Introduce performance-driven programs or early-access tools to help mid-tier sellers scale up. Encourage more balanced seller contribution to reduce risk. |
| **Low adoption of debit cards, vouchers, and boleto** | Create awareness campaigns or discounts specific to underused payment methods. This diversifies transaction risk and enhances inclusivity. |
| **Very low cancellation rate (~0%)** | Excellent operational performance — highlight this in marketing as a trust-builder (“99%+ delivery rate”). Keep investing in fulfillment ops. |

## 🧩 Key Code Snippets

### 📥 1. Importing Data and Setting Up SQLite

```python
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('ecommerce.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

orders = pd.read_csv('olist_orders_dataset.csv')
order_items = pd.read_csv('olist_order_items_dataset.csv')
products = pd.read_csv('olist_products_dataset.csv')
```

---

### 🔗 2. Merging Order Items with Product Data

```python
items_with_products = pd.merge(order_items, products, on='product_id')
sales_data = pd.merge(items_with_products, orders, on='order_id')
```

---

### 🧮 3. Feature Engineering: Order Value and Delivery Time

```python
sales_data['total_order_value'] = sales_data['price'] + sales_data['freight_value']
sales_data['delivery_time_days'] = (sales_data['order_delivered_customer_date'] -
                                    sales_data['order_purchase_timestamp']).dt.days
```

---

### 💳 4. Aggregating Payment Details

```python
payments_agg = payments.groupby('order_id').agg({
    'payment_type': lambda x: x.mode()[0],
    'payment_installments': 'mean',
    'payment_value': 'sum'
}).reset_index()

sales_data = sales_data.merge(payments_agg, on='order_id', how='left')
```

---

### 📈 5. Monthly Revenue by Payment Type

```python
sales_data['order_month'] = sales_data['order_purchase_timestamp'].dt.to_period('M')

monthly_revenue_by_payment = (
    sales_data.groupby(['order_month', 'primary_payment_type'])['total_order_value']
    .sum().reset_index()
)
```
